- reinforcement learning in minecraft
	- Grid world:
		- Problem: navigating to a goal location as fast as possible
		- First thought: let's just hardcode the path to the solution
			- Doesn't generalize, we'd have to program all solutions
			- our agent doesn't have all the information up front
		- We need a way to specify what to do, but not how to do it
			- reward correct behavior
			- agent should "learn" how to perform correctly
		- Solution: Q-learning 
			- positive reward for reaching location, 
			- negative reward for every other command
	
	- Resource gathering:
		- Problem: collecting resources
		- Solution:
